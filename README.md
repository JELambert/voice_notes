# Voice Notes Application

Goal of this is to have an application that:
1. Takes on a voice recording (v1. is just mp4)
2. Utilizes Whisper to transcribe to text
3. Takes that text and submits it to an LLM (tbd model, starting with gpt3.5)
4. LLM with the new input and existing prompts that help tune it, then converts that into a markdown readable file. 

#### Issues
* How are we adding links to the internet?
